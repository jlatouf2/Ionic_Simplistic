## Description

NOTE:
AnguarJS can be used and it will work for some of it, but if you want the ionic styling and for it to work completely you
must use the ionic IN THE CSS [ie. the javascript works the same in ionic, but the stuff view needs the ionic
html code]

TO USE ANY OF THESE THINGS YOU MUST:

 ionic start todo 
$ ionic start myApp blank
$ ionic start myApp tabs
$ ionic start myApp sidemenu

1) start server: node chat-server.js

2) Ionic serve 
OR
-cordova platform add iOS
-cordova build iOS
-cordova emulate iOS
